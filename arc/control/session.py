"""Control sessions — ARC takes the mouse and keyboard, visibly and reversibly.

Three guarantees, in priority order:

1. **You can always take it back.** Moving the mouse yourself ends the session
   immediately. So does Escape, so does ``arc control release``, so does ``arc-kill``.
   None of these depend on the agent being responsive, because the moment you most
   need to reclaim control is the moment the agent is misbehaving.
2. **You can always tell.** A blue glow surrounds every display for exactly as long as
   ARC holds control. It appears before the first synthetic event and disappears after
   the last.
3. **It cannot get stuck on.** The overlay is a child process and the session is a
   context manager, so an exception, a crash, or a kill all release control and clear
   the glow.

Takeover detection compares the real pointer position against where ARC last put it.
Polling rather than an event tap: a tap needs its own Accessibility grant and a run
loop, and the failure mode of polling — noticing a takeover 100 ms late — is far kinder
than the failure mode of a tap that silently stops delivering events.
