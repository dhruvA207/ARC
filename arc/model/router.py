"""Backend selection.

The router answers one question: given this machine and this registry entry, which
backend actually runs it? It reads ``~/.arc/hardware.json`` rather than probing, per
ADR-002 — the probe already ran at startup and everything downstream reads its output.

Selection is deliberately explainable. ``choose_backend`` returns *why* it chose, so
``arc doctor`` and ``arc model list`` can show the reasoning instead of presenting a
decision the user has to reverse-engineer.
