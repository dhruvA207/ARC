"""Local HTTP server — the warm process.

Two of §7's items turn out to be the same feature. "Model warm-loading" and "a local
HTTP/WebSocket API for a future GUI" both want one thing: a process that holds the model
and memory resident so nothing pays to load them again.

Measured cost of *not* having it: 1.98s to load the model and 0.18s for the embedder,
on every single ``arc do`` or ``arc chat``. Against a task that then runs for ten
seconds, that is a fifth of the wall clock spent re-reading files that were already in
memory a moment ago.

**Binds to 127.0.0.1 only.** ARC has unrestricted access to this machine (§0.3), so an
HTTP endpoint that reaches it must not be reachable from the network. This is not a
configurable setting — a bind address is exactly the kind of thing that gets loosened
"temporarily" and left that way.

Built on ``http.server`` rather than a framework. The surface is five endpoints, and §7
says to treat dependencies as a liability.
