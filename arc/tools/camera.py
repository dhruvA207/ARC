"""Camera gesture control, as tools the agent can call.

The feature itself lives in :mod:`arc.vision.hands` and runs as its own process. These
are the handles: start it, stop it, ask whether it is on. Nothing more — this is a
switch, the equivalent of typing a command in a terminal to start gesture control and
another to stop it, with ARC doing the typing.

Starting is mutating even though nothing is typed or clicked at the moment of the call.
It opens the cameras and leaves a process that will move the pointer, and ``--dry-run``
promising not to touch the machine has to mean that.
