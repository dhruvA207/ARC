"""The accessibility tree — reading the screen structurally.

§4.3 puts this first for good reason: it is exact, fast, and free. A vision model looks
at pixels and *infers* that something is a button; the accessibility tree is what the
application itself declares, including the element's role, its label, whether it is
enabled, and precisely where it is. Clicking an AX element's own frame does not drift
when a window moves or the resolution changes, which pixel targeting does constantly.

macOS exposes this through AXUIElement. It requires the Accessibility grant — the same
one input control needs — and returns nothing at all without it, so a missing grant is
detected and reported rather than looking like an empty screen.

The tree can be enormous. A browser window may expose tens of thousands of elements, so
traversal is depth- and count-limited, and elements with no label and no interactivity
are skipped: they are layout containers, and listing them buries the handful of things
an agent can actually act on.
