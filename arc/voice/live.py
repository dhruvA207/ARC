"""Gemini Live: one bidirectional audio session for the whole conversation.

This replaces the earlier REST approach, which was the wrong API. ``generateContent``
with the ``-tts`` model costs one HTTP request *per sentence* and draws on a per-model
free-tier quota of ten requests a day — a single three-sentence reply spent three of
them. JARVIS never hit that wall because it never used that endpoint: it opens one
WebSocket to ``gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-preview`` and streams audio both ways for
the life of the conversation. Sessions are metered by time, not by request count.

**The trade this makes is real and worth restating.** Your microphone audio is streamed
to Google while the session is open. Apple's on-device recogniser only ever sent text
off the machine — this sends the audio itself. BRIEF §0 says local-first; Dhruv chose
this deliberately, so ``arc voice status`` and ``arc doctor`` both say plainly that
audio leaves the machine, and every session is audited.

End-of-speech detection is Gemini's, not ours: ``automatic_activity_detection`` with
the same 400 ms silence window JARVIS tuned. The adaptive endpoint detector written for
the Apple path is therefore unused here — the server decides when you have stopped.

Audio format is fixed by the API: 16 kHz mono int16 up, 24 kHz mono int16 down.
