# Project ARC — Build Brief

**Claude, this is the full spec for what I want us to build together. Read all of it before you start.**

I'm Dhruv. It's July 2026. We are not doing voice, speech, or TTS yet — that comes later, so ignore
it entirely for now.

---

## 0. START HERE — WHAT I ACTUALLY MEAN

Read this section carefully. If anything later in this brief seems to contradict it, this section
wins.

### 0.1 What I mean by "no license"

I have a JARVIS right now that's built on top of a licensed GitHub repo, and I want to get away from
that. When I say I want something with "no license," here's what I actually need you to understand:

Every piece of software has a license. That's unavoidable. My real problem with what I have now
isn't that a license exists — it's that I didn't design the architecture, I don't fully understand
code I didn't write, and I might be bound by attribution or copyleft terms I haven't thought through.

So here's what I want instead: **I own 100% of the application code, and every dependency is
permissively licensed — Apache-2.0 or MIT only.** Those licenses cost me nothing. No royalties, no
usage caps, no commercial restrictions, no copyleft. Apache-2.0 also includes an explicit patent
grant that MIT doesn't. Under those terms, this system is genuinely mine — to run, modify, sell, or
close-source however I want.

**This is a hard rule for you: never pull in a GPL, AGPL, SSPL, "research-only," "non-commercial," or
custom-community-licensed dependency.** If the best library for something is copyleft, use the
second-best permissive one and note the tradeoff for me in `docs/DEPENDENCIES.md`. Start that file at
commit #1 and keep it current — I want a running ledger of every dependency and its license.

### 0.2 What I mean by "build my own LLM"

I know there are two different projects hiding in what I'm asking for, and I want both, running in
parallel. Don't blur them together:

| | **Track A — The Agent** | **Track B — The Model** |
|---|---|---|
| What it is | JARVIS itself: memory, tools, OS control, screen reading, web research, reasoning | A transformer LLM I train from raw text |
| Whose code | Mine, written by us | Mine, written by us |
| The brain | An Apache-2.0 open-weight model running locally | The model I train |
| Timeline | Weeks. I want it usable fast. | Months. This is how I learn ML. |
| Realistic quality | An actually useful assistant | A small model, roughly GPT-2 to GPT-3-small grade |

**Be blunt with me about the ceiling here and don't let it get fuzzy.** I understand that training
something competitive with Claude or GPT or Gemini from scratch would take $10M–$100M+ in compute, a
data team, and a cluster. That's not a solo project and I'm not pretending otherwise. What I *can* do
solo — and what I want — is train a real model end to end and understand every piece of it.

Because of that split, **the model has to be a swappable component behind a stable interface.**
Track A ships now on open weights. Track B trains my own model. When Track B produces something, it
drops into the same socket with a one-line config change. This is the most important architectural
decision in the whole project. Design for it from day one.

### 0.3 How much access it gets

I want **full, unrestricted access to my machine. No permission prompts, no deny-list.** It reads and
writes anywhere my user account can, runs any shell command, controls mouse and keyboard, captures
the screen, launches any app — without asking me first. That's deliberate, and I don't want you
negotiating it.

Two things I *do* want you to build, not as guardrails but because I'll need them to debug this
thing:

1. **An append-only action log** at `~/.arc/audit/*.jsonl` — every tool call, its arguments, its
   result, timestamped. When this thing does something weird at 2am I need to be able to see what
   happened.
2. **A hard kill switch** — global hotkey plus an `arc kill` command that SIGKILLs the process tree
   and releases input control immediately. An agent with mouse and keyboard control that hits a loop
   can make my machine unusable. I always need to be able to stop it.

Also build a `--dry-run` mode that logs intended actions without executing them. Not for safety — I
just know we'll need it constantly while developing.

Don't add confirmation prompts, deny-lists, or capability sandboxes. Do build the config plumbing in
`config/policy.yaml` so I can turn that stuff on later if I change my mind, but default everything to
permissive.

---

## 1. WHAT WE'RE BUILDING

**ARC** — my personal, local-first, fully-owned AI assistant. It needs to:

1. Run a language model **locally** on my machine by default — Ollama, serving whatever open
   model fits. Local-only used to be a hard requirement here; it isn't anymore. A cloud model
   (Claude, via the Anthropic API) is available as an opt-in toggle for when a task wants more
   reasoning power than the local model has — switched to on purpose, not a silent fallback. See
   docs/DECISIONS.md ADR-025.
2. Have **persistent long-term memory** — a real memory system, not a chat log — that accumulates
   knowledge about me, my files, my projects, and past conversations across sessions.
3. Have **unrestricted local access** — read/write any file, run any command, launch and control any
   application.
4. **See my screen** (capture + vision model + OCR) and **control it** (mouse, keyboard).
5. **Research on the open web** when its memory isn't enough, then **write what it learned back into
   memory** so it doesn't look the same thing up twice.
6. Keep the **model swappable**, including for the model I train myself.
7. Contain **zero code copied from a third-party agent framework.** Permissive libraries only —
   PyTorch, transformers, llama.cpp, sqlite. The agent architecture is mine.

Call it `arc`. Root at `~/arc`, runtime data in `~/.arc/`.

---

## 2. MY HARDWARE SITUATION

I'm on **Apple Silicon (macOS)** right now, but I'm planning to **switch to Windows** before too
long. So:

- **Write platform-agnostic code by default.** Anything OS-specific lives behind interfaces in
  `arc/platform/`, with `macos.py`, `windows.py`, and `linux.py` implementations picked at runtime by
  a factory in `arc/platform/__init__.py`.
- **Never** call a macOS-only API from business logic. If you need `osascript`, it goes in
  `platform/macos.py` behind something like `open_application(name: str)` that `windows.py`
  implements its own way.
- `pathlib.Path` everywhere. Never string-concatenate paths, never hardcode `/` or `\`.
- The inference layer needs to support Metal/MLX (my Mac now), CUDA (Windows later), and CPU
  (fallback). Detect at startup, pick automatically, let me override in config.
- **First thing in Phase 1:** a hardware probe that writes `~/.arc/hardware.json` — OS, arch, CPU
  cores, RAM, GPU vendor/model, VRAM or unified memory, available accelerator backends. Everything
  downstream (model size, quantization, batch size) reads from that file instead of assuming.

Size the local model against available memory roughly like this:

| Memory available for the model | What to run |
|---|---|
| ≤ 8 GB | 3–4B params, 4-bit quantized |
| 16 GB | 7–8B, 4-bit |
| 32 GB | 14B 4-bit, or 8B at 8-bit |
| 64 GB+ | 30B-class MoE 4-bit |
| 128 GB+ | 70B 4-bit, or a large MoE |

---

## 3. PICKING THE BRAIN FOR TRACK A

**Apache-2.0 licensed open weights only.** As of mid-2026 my understanding of the good permissive
options is:

- **Qwen3** (Alibaba) — Apache-2.0, ~1.7B up to 235B, strong tool calling and coding. Probably my
  default.
- **Mistral Small / Mistral Large 3** — Apache-2.0, clean licensing, strong reasoning.
- **Gemma 4** — Apache-2.0, efficient, good quality per parameter, MoE variants available.

**Don't default to Llama** — Meta's community license isn't Apache or MIT and carries conditions I
don't want. Nothing tagged research-only or non-commercial.

**Verify every model's license yourself before you hardcode it** by fetching its Hugging Face model
card. Licenses change between releases and I don't want to rely on my memory or yours. Record what
you find — URL and date checked — in `docs/DEPENDENCIES.md`. If something I named turns out to be
non-permissive, pick something else and tell me why.

Same rule for the **vision model** (Qwen-VL line is the obvious default) and the **embedding model**
(small, CPU-capable, fully local — no embedding API calls).

### 4.1 The model interface — get this exactly right

`arc/model/base.py` is what makes the brain swappable. Every backend implements it, including the
model I eventually train. Keep it as **narrow as possible** so a from-scratch model has a realistic
shot at satisfying it:

```python
class LanguageModel(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def generate(self, messages: list[Message], *,
                 tools: list[ToolSchema] | None = None,
                 max_tokens: int = 2048,
                 temperature: float = 0.7,
                 stop: list[str] | None = None) -> Completion: ...

    @abstractmethod
    def stream(self, ...) -> Iterator[Token]: ...

    @abstractmethod
    def count_tokens(self, text: str) -> int: ...

    @property
    @abstractmethod
    def context_length(self) -> int: ...

    @property
    @abstractmethod
    def capabilities(self) -> ModelCapabilities:
        """native_tool_calling, vision, json_mode, max_context, etc."""
```

**Important:** my own model won't have native tool calling, and neither will small open models. Build
a `capabilities`-aware fallback in `agent/executor.py` — if `native_tool_calling` is False, drop to a
prompted ReAct-style protocol where the model emits a parseable block (fenced JSON) that the executor
extracts with a **tolerant** parser. Build that parser properly, with repair heuristics for truncated
or malformed JSON. This is specifically what will let my own model drive the agent later, so don't
treat it as an afterthought.

### 4.2 Memory — this is the part I care most about

When I say "its own memory cache with full capabilities," I don't mean dumping chat history into a
vector DB. I want three cooperating layers plus a consolidation process:

- **Episodic** — timestamped events and conversation turns, vector + relational hybrid. Answers "what
  did we do last Tuesday?"
- **Semantic** — extracted facts and entities with typed relationships, stored as a graph (nodes and
  edges in SQLite). Answers "who is X and how do they relate to Y?" Supports multi-hop.
- **Procedural** — learned workflows and my preferences. "When Dhruv says 'clean up downloads' he
  means this." Written by the consolidation process out of repeated episodic patterns.

**Storage:** SQLite with the `sqlite-vec` extension. One file, no server, trivially portable across
my macOS→Windows migration, and my whole memory becomes a single backup-able artifact. Don't
introduce a server-based vector DB.

**Retrieval has to be hybrid, run in parallel, and rerank:**

1. Dense vector similarity
2. BM25 keyword match (SQLite FTS5)
3. Entity/graph traversal from entities in the query
4. Recency-weighted scan

Merge, dedupe, rerank on a combined score, then fit into the working-memory budget.

**Consolidation** runs in the background on idle and on a schedule: dedupe near-identical memories,
summarize long episodic runs into compact semantic facts, decay salience of unused memories, promote
repeated patterns into procedural memory. Log everything it changes to the audit log — I don't want
silent memory mutation.

**Write-back:** when it researches something on the web, the distilled result goes into semantic
memory with source URL and timestamp. Asking the same question later should hit memory, not the
network. Facts carry confidence and age, and time-sensitive categories get re-verified instead of
trusted forever.

### 4.3 Screen access

- **Capture:** cross-platform, multi-monitor, region-croppable, with configurable downscaling before
  it hits the vision model. Full-resolution screenshots will destroy the token budget.
- **Understanding, cheapest method first:**
  1. Native accessibility tree (macOS AX API / Windows UI Automation) — structured, fast, exact. Use
     this whenever it's available; it's dramatically better than pixels.
  2. Local OCR for dense text regions.
  3. Vision-language model for real visual understanding and element localization.
- **Control:** mouse move/click/drag/scroll, keyboard type/hotkey, platform-abstracted. Prefer
  accessibility-API targeting over raw pixel coordinates — pixel targeting breaks every time a window
  moves or the resolution changes.
- Cache screen state with a short TTL so repeated queries in one reasoning step don't re-capture.

### 4.4 Web research

Fetch → extract main content → strip boilerplate → chunk → summarize against my query → write to
semantic memory with provenance. Respect `robots.txt`, rate-limit yourself, and use a headless
browser when a plain fetch returns an empty JS shell. Every fact from the web carries its source URL
and retrieval date, and it has to be able to cite that when I ask.

---

## 5. BUILD PHASES

Work these in order. **After each phase: run the tests, commit with a real message, and give me a
short summary of what works now and what I can try.** Don't barrel through all eight silently.

### Phase 1 — Foundation

Repo scaffold, `pyproject.toml`, config loader, structured logging, audit logger, kill switch,
hardware probe writing `hardware.json`, platform abstraction with macOS implemented and
Windows/Linux stubbed, an `arc doctor` command that reports my environment. Tests for config and the
probe. Start `docs/DEPENDENCIES.md`.

### Phase 2 — The brain

`LanguageModel` ABC. llama.cpp backend (works everywhere) plus the MLX fast path for my Mac. Model
management CLI — `arc model pull`, `arc model list`, `arc model use`. Router that picks a backend
from `hardware.json`. Streaming, token counting, and an `arc chat` REPL. Stateless is fine, but by
the end of this phase I want to be talking to a local model. **Verify each license before adding it
to `models.yaml`.**

### Phase 3 — Memory

SQLite + sqlite-vec schema. Local embedder. Three memory layers. Hybrid retrieval. Working-memory
budget manager. Consolidation job. `arc memory` subcommands: `search`, `add`, `stats`, `export`,
`forget`. Wire memory into `arc chat` so conversations survive restarts. **Test with several thousand
synthetic memories** — retrieval problems only show up at scale.

### Phase 4 — Tools and the agent loop

Tool registry with decorator registration and auto-generated JSON schemas. Filesystem, shell, and
code tools. The agent loop with planning, execution, error recovery, step limits. Native tool-calling
path plus the prompted-ReAct fallback and tolerant parser. Audit logging on every call. By the end of
this phase ARC should be doing real multi-step work on my files and shell.

### Phase 5 — Web

Search, fetch, extraction, headless-browser fallback, summarization, memory write-back with
provenance, staleness policy.

### Phase 6 — Screen and control

Capture, per-platform accessibility-tree readers, OCR, VLM integration, input control, element
targeting. Most platform-specific phase — keep the abstraction clean, all of this gets rewritten for
Windows.

### Phase 7 — Integration and hardening

End-to-end tests of realistic multi-tool tasks. Performance profiling — find the slow paths, which
will probably be embedding and screenshot encoding. Crash recovery and resumable tasks. Local
HTTP/WebSocket server. Startup time and model warm-loading.

### Phase 8 — Consolidation on this machine

> **Revised 2026-07-30.** This was "Windows readiness". I am not moving ARC to another
> machine — it runs on this Mac, and the Windows laptop is only a Track B training
> appliance (`docs/DECISIONS.md` ADR-007). So the CI matrix, the full
> `platform/windows.py`, and the CUDA/vLLM backend are all off the table, and the
> platform abstraction stays as an architectural boundary rather than something to be
> built out speculatively.

What is actually left:

- **Verify every command works here**, not in principle. Done: all 21 CLI commands run
  clean on this machine.
- **Config that actually takes effect.** Twelve keys in `config/default.yaml` were
  declared and then never read, with the values hardcoded in the modules — so editing
  them did nothing at all. Silent no-ops are worse than missing settings.
- **Backup and restore of `~/.arc/`.** Still worth documenting, not for migration but
  because it holds the memory database, and a machine can fail without being replaced.
- **Honest failure on the parts that need macOS.** Screen capture, OCR, the
  accessibility tree, and input control are macOS-only by construction. They must say
  so rather than fail mysteriously.

`arc/platform/` stays. It costs nothing, it is where the OS-specific code already
lives, and it is the reason the core imports cleanly without any Apple framework
present.

## 6. TRACK B — MY OWN MODEL (SHELVED)

> **Shelved 2026-07-30.** I am not pursuing Track B. ARC works on an Apache-2.0
> open-weight model and that is enough — §0.1's ownership goal was always about
> licensing, and a permissively-licensed model already satisfies it completely. Nothing
> below was built; there is no training code in this repository.
>
> The section is kept rather than deleted because it records how the scope moved and
> why, which is worth more than a clean file. See `docs/DECISIONS.md` ADR-023.
>
> If it is ever revived, `config/training.yaml` and `docs/ML_CURRICULUM.md` (stages 0-2)
> are the starting points, and the constraint that mattered still holds: use a
> pretrained base, and no run longer than about a week.

<details>
<summary>The plan as it stood when shelved</summary>



> **Revised 2026-07-28.** This section originally planned a from-scratch model pretrained on a
> rented 8×H100 node for 24 hours, with compute-credit tracking and spot-instance handling. I
> have no rented compute and won't be getting any, so that plan described infrastructure that
> would never exist. What replaced it is below; the reasoning is in `docs/DECISIONS.md`
> (ADR-008). The original text is in git history.

Track B is where I get a model that is genuinely mine, and where I learn ML. It runs alongside
Track A, not instead of it.

### 6.0 What changed, and why it's still worth doing

I'm not training an LLM from scratch at a useful scale. That would need a cluster I don't have.
What I *am* doing is taking an Apache-2.0 base model and making it mine through fine-tuning.

**That fully satisfies §0.1.** A fine-tune of Apache-2.0 weights is mine to run, modify, sell,
or close-source. The only obligation travelling to the derivative is NOTICE attribution for the
base. From-scratch training was never what made this mine — it was about learning, and I can
get most of that far more cheaply.

**Be blunt with me about the ceiling, same as before.** A fine-tuned 7–8B model inherits its
base's competence and gains my voice, my preferences, and ARC's tool-call format. It will not
become smarter than its base. What it becomes is *specialised*, which is the thing no
off-the-shelf model can be.

### 6.1 The hard constraint: no run longer than about a week

**The deliverable fine-tune is measured in hours, not days.** A ~20K-example QLoRA SFT run is
roughly five hours on my hardware; a 5K-example set is under two. I can run ten experiments in
a week. Using a pretrained base is precisely what buys this, and I don't want it quietly eroded
by scope creep back toward multi-day runs.

If something in this plan starts implying a multi-day job, that's a signal to shrink the model
or the dataset, not to accept the longer run.

### 6.2 Hardware

Training happens on my Windows laptop (i9-13900HS, 32 GB RAM, 8 GB VRAM), used as a batch
appliance. ARC itself runs on the MacBook Air — see `docs/DECISIONS.md` ADR-007 for why those
are different machines.

Budget **~6.5 GB usable VRAM**, not 8: Windows reserves some for the desktop compositor and
GPU-accelerated browsers, and the machine isn't dedicated to this.

**Unverified assumption to settle first:** everything here assumes that GPU is NVIDIA. If it's
Intel Arc or AMD, ROCm and oneAPI on Windows are poor enough that this plan needs rethinking.
`nvidia-smi` answers it.

### 6.3 The two pieces of work

**A — The fine-tune. This is the deliverable.**

QLoRA on a 7–8B Apache-2.0 base (Qwen3 family; verify the licence on the live model card before
committing to a variant, per §3). A 4-bit 7B is ~3.5 GB of weights, leaving room for adapters
and activations inside 6.5 GB — this is exactly the case QLoRA was designed for.

Two rounds, and the first does not wait for the second's data:

1. **v1 on a public instruction dataset.** Days of setup, hours of training. Produces a working
   custom model and proves the whole pipeline end to end.
2. **v2 on my own data** — my notes, my writing, my tool-call traces from Track A — once ARC has
   been running long enough to have generated them. Identical pipeline, better data.

Doing v1 first is deliberate: pipeline bugs surface against cheap public data instead of after
months of trace collection.

**B — The from-scratch model. Optional, and purely for the curriculum.**

A 5–10M parameter transformer written from scratch, trained on TinyStories. A few hours. It
writes simple coherent stories and nothing else, and that is the entire point — I get to build
autograd, a BPE tokenizer, attention, and a training loop with my own hands, and watch real loss
curves, without it blocking anything useful.

It could be scaled to ~200M on a real corpus, which would be GPT-2-small grade. That's a ~3-day
run and it buys education rather than capability, so it's out of scope unless I explicitly ask.

### 6.4 The curriculum

`docs/ML_CURRICULUM.md` is a genuine teaching document, not a runbook. Explain the math and the
intuition, not just which API to call. `training/NOTEBOOK.md` is a real lab notebook: every run,
its config, its loss curve, what I learned.

**Stage 0 — Foundations.** Tensors and autograd from first principles, backprop by hand on a
tiny network, a bigram language model, then a single self-attention head. Don't let me skip
this.

**Stage 1 — Tokenizer.** BPE from scratch. Why vocab size trades against sequence length, and
why tokenization causes so many failures people blame on models.

**Stage 2 — The transformer.** PyTorch, from scratch, no `transformers` library: multi-head
attention, RoPE, RMSNorm, SwiGLU, residual stream, causal masking, KV cache. Modern
architecture, not the 2017 original. Every component gets a docstring explaining *why* it
exists.

**Stage 3 — Data.** For the from-scratch model, TinyStories. For the fine-tune, instruction
data and my own traces. Cleaning, dedup, formatting, and the data-quality-to-model-quality
relationship, which I gather is the most underrated thing in practical ML.

**Stage 4 — Training the small model.** AdamW, cosine schedule with warmup, gradient clipping,
mixed precision, gradient accumulation, checkpointing, resume. Teach me to read a loss curve —
what divergence looks like, how to size a model against available compute.

**Stage 5 — Fine-tuning.** SFT, LoRA/QLoRA, optionally DPO. This is where the deliverable comes
from.

**Stage 6 — Evaluation.** Perplexity, task benchmarks, an honest qualitative harness, and a
direct comparison against the stock base model so I can see exactly what my fine-tune changed —
including where it made things worse.

**Stage 7 — Integration.** `arc/model/custom.py`, so my model satisfies the `LanguageModel`
interface and I can select it with `arc model use custom`. Since the fine-tune shares its base's
architecture, this is nearly free — which is the swappable-brain design (§4.1) paying off.

### 6.5 Interruption and resume — still required

The justification changed but the requirement didn't. A run gets interrupted because the laptop
throttled, or because I need it back — not because a spot instance got preempted.

- Checkpoint every N steps, tuned so I lose at most ~10 minutes of work.
- Every checkpoint carries model weights, optimizer state, LR scheduler state, RNG state,
  dataloader position, and step count — everything needed for a **bit-exact resume**.
- Write to a temp file and atomically rename. Never leave a half-written checkpoint.
- `training/RESUME.md` documenting the exact commands to bring a run back.

CLI, unchanged in spirit:

```
arc train status      # step, elapsed, throughput, est. time to finish
arc train pause       # graceful checkpoint-and-stop right now
arc train resume      # resume from latest checkpoint
```

**Dropped along with the rented cluster:** dollar budgets, `hourly_rate_usd`, compute-credit
thresholds, cloud checkpoint upload, `supervisor.py` instance re-provisioning, and
`RENTING_GPUS.md`. There are no compute credits to track. My Claude Code usage limits still
exist, but those stop *our working session*, not a training job, and don't need a `BudgetTracker`
to manage.

### 6.6 Measure before promising

Sustained throughput on that laptop is unknown, and my estimates for it span a factor of 2.5 —
which makes every derived run-time figure fiction. **The first Track B task is a benchmark** over
a window long enough to throttle. No predicted training times go into any doc before then, and
`config/training.yaml` keeps its dimensions `null` until they come from a measurement rather
than a guess.

## 7. HOW I WANT THE CODE WRITTEN

- **Python 3.12+.** Full type hints on every public function. `mypy --strict` clean. `ruff` for
  format and lint.
- **Docstrings explain *why*, not *what*.** This codebase is a teaching artifact for me too.
- **Test as we go** with `pytest` — unit tests for pure logic, integration tests for tools, a small
  end-to-end suite. Don't defer testing to the end.
- **Treat dependencies as a liability.** Before adding one, ask whether 50 lines of my own code would
  do. Every dependency gets a row in `docs/DEPENDENCIES.md` with its license and why it's there.
- **Config over constants.** No magic numbers in logic — they go in `config/`.
- **Fail loudly, recover gracefully.** Never swallow an exception silently. The agent loop catches
  tool errors, feeds them back to the model as observations, and adapts.
- **Structured logging** (JSONL), not print statements.
- **Commit per meaningful unit** with real messages. Keep `docs/DECISIONS.md` as an architecture
  decision record — what we chose, what we rejected, and why.
- **Async where it pays** — I/O-bound tool calls, parallel retrieval. Not everywhere.

## 8. HOW I WANT YOU TO WORK WITH ME

- **Ask me before assuming.** When a decision has real tradeoffs — model choice, memory schema, how
  aggressive consolidation should be, how to spend the training budget — lay out the options and let
  me pick.
- **Teach me as you build.** I'm doing this to learn ML and systems engineering. When you implement
  something non-obvious, explain the concept in your summary, not just the code.
- **Tell me when something won't work.** If I ask for something infeasible, say so directly and
  propose the closest thing that is. Don't build me something impressive-looking that doesn't
  actually work.
- **Ship working increments.** Every phase ends with something I can run. Don't vanish for eight
  phases and hand me a monolith.
- **Don't over-engineer early.** Phase 1 doesn't need a plugin system. The swappable brain and the
  platform abstraction are load-bearing — build those properly and keep everything else simple until
  it needs not to be.

## 9. WHAT TO DO RIGHT NOW

1. Confirm you've read and understood Section 0 (licensing, the two tracks, full access) and Section
   4.1 (the swappable brain). State them back to me briefly so I know we're aligned.
2. Ask me anything that would change Phase 1 or 2 — where to put the project, Python version manager,
   preferred model family, and what my actual GPU budget is for the Track B 24-hour run.
3. Run the hardware probe on this machine and tell me what it found and what model size that implies.
4. Propose a concrete Phase 1 file list for my approval.
5. Once I approve, build Phase 1, test it, commit it, and report back.

**Don't start Phase 2 until Phase 1 runs and I've confirmed it.**
