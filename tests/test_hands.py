"""Tests for camera gesture recognition, cross-camera fusion, and the air mouse.

The fusion tests carry the most weight. Gesture *recognition* failing is obvious — you
wave at the camera and nothing happens. Fusion failing is not: it deletes a gesture
that both the recogniser and the preview agree it can see, which is what made fist and
pinch look dead while cursor control kept working.

Nothing here needs a camera, MediaPipe, or a window server.
